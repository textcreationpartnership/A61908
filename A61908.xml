            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">Lam. 2.1.</note> How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> with a Cloud in his anger, and caſt down from Heaven unto the Earth the beauty of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and remembred not his Foot-ſtool in the day of his anger? He hath violently taken away his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, as <hi>if it were of</hi> a Garden;

<note place="margin">Pſal. 74.9.</note> neither <hi>is there</hi> among us any that knoweth How Long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When we,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.1, 2.</note> like</hi> David, <hi>were</hi> reſtoring the Ark of God, <hi>I mean, the preſence of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>in his Worſhip and Ordinances, what</hi> Stumblings <hi>of the</hi> Oxen <hi>have we ſeen? What miſerable Diſappointments have we met with? And what ſad</hi> breaches <hi>have there been made? How hath God ſtopt our way, and</hi> branded <hi>our Enterpriſes with wonderful</hi> remarks <hi>of his ſore diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear <hi>therefore</hi> the word of the Lord,
<note place="margin">Hoſ, 4.1.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:49727:3"/>ye Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the Lord hath a Controverſie with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Land. <hi>We poor Miniſters have pleaded with you, till we can plead no more: the Lord hath bid us stand by, whileſt he himſelf takes up the Controverſte. O is it not</hi> a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God?
<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.31.</note> 
               <hi>Are you not ſenſible what Arrows God hath begun to ſhoot amongst us? How many thouſands,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 58.9. Iſa. 5.25.</note> and ten thouſands hath he</hi> taken away as with a whirlwind <hi>by the Peſtilence?</hi> For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill. <hi>How hath God</hi> ſhaken <hi>our</hi> Heavens,
<note place="margin">Hag. 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>and our</hi> Earth; <hi>the</hi> Sea, <hi>as well as</hi> dry Land? <hi>How doth he contend still by the Sword? And how much precious blood hath the Earth and Sea drunk up?</hi> For all this his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O! Come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 46.8.</note> Behold the works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath made in the Earth. <hi>Every Providence of God, (eſpecially his more notable Acts) hath a reaſon written upon it, could mans eye read it. When the Church complained that God was</hi> as a ſtranger in the Land,
<note place="margin">Jer. 14.8, 10.</note> and as a wayfaring man, <hi>that</hi> turneth aſide
<pb facs="tcp:49727:4"/>to tarry for a night: <hi>The Lord replyes to them,</hi> Thus have they loved to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c. The Controverſie began on their ſide: they may ſee their</hi> Sin <hi>in the</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>as in a</hi> Glaſs. <hi>Do they win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I grow ſtrange to them? The eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment began on their part. Nothing appears more our</hi> inſtant <hi>Duty, than to enter a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſcrutiny,</hi> What have we done? <hi>Wherein have we offended?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 3.40, 41, 44.</note> Let us ſearch and try our wayes, (<hi>ſaith the afflicted Church of</hi> Judah, <hi>upon this very occaſion, of</hi> the Lords covering himſelf with a Cloud, that their Prayers could not paſs through) and turn again to the Lord. Let us lift up our heart, with our hands, unto God in the Heavens. <hi>O!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hag. 1.5.7.</note> Conſider your wayes: <hi>The Lord doubled it,</hi> Your iniquities have ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated between you and your God,

            <p>
               <hi>I find men will eaſily ſubſcribe to this, that Sin is the procuring cauſe of all miſery; but I find an aptneſs to transferr the guilt from one to another, from one party to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and though people do even</hi> ſell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to work wickedneſs, <hi>yet ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant is Self-love, that it ſees no ſpots
<pb facs="tcp:49727:4"/>in it ſelf.</hi> Ahab <hi>is not</hi> the troubler of Iſrael, <hi>but</hi> Elijah: <hi>Nay, a good man,</hi> Aaron <hi>excuſeth himſelf,
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.22.</note> and layes the blame on others. The Sin is theirs, not mine.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And indeed, Sin is ſuch an ugly Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that no man will own it, if he can chooſe; but had rather lay this</hi> Child of Darkneſs <hi>at any</hi> mans <hi>door, yea at</hi> Gods, <hi>than</hi> Father <hi>it himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Deſign in this Enterprize, is, to obviate this Distemper, and to bring you,</hi> all <hi>of you, to own</hi> your <hi>iniquity; that you may ſay (reſolve upon it) that you</hi> will confeſs your iniquity,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.5.</note> 
               <hi>that ſo</hi> God <hi>may</hi> forgive the iniquity of your ſin. <hi>My Place, and Duty, as a Minister (though wholly unworthy of that Relation to God and you) binds me to</hi> cauſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to know her abominations;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.2.</note> 
               <hi>and therefore I have deſcended to Particulars, that, if it be the will of God, I might hit the humour,

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord knoweth, I take no pleaſure to

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I thank God for the freedome that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brother hath taken with the ejected Ministers:

Though my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Diſtempers pleaded loud for my ſilence; though I was told, the prudent ſhould hold their peace in an evil day; though I know 'tis an unthankful office to admoniſh and reprove,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet I have laid by all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments and Objections that Self was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding; and wiſh I had ſuch gifts, and ſuch affections, and ſuch a diſcerning of the hearts and lives of Profeſſours, as might render me ſome way uſeful, to put you upon ſelf-reflection, upon ſelf-tryal, in order to a full Repentance: I pray God, I may ſo farr at least ſucceed, as to obſtruct that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed exclaiming againſt the ſins of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb facs="tcp:49727:5"/>and the ſins of divided Parties, as at length to make you cry out,</hi> What have I done? <hi>O! how have I provoked God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Out of pity to your ſouls have I underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this ſubject: Our pangs, like thoſe of a travailling Woman, are hastening: the Clouds are ſwelling, I am loth they ſhould fall on you in a ſecure and impenitent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am not aſhamed to tell you, that I foreſee foul weather; and I would you ſhould be in readineſs for boiſterous Seas. I know nothing ſave guilt will then ſink your hearts: the load of affliction will be ſo heavy and hard upon you, that I would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe (not the load of millions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented ſins) at the ſame time, to preſs you down.

O! if there be no other way to eſcape, but through Chriſt, O! then for a Chriſt, then Sermons and Miniſters are welcome, in hopes of bringing in (not ſo much a Chriſt, as) peace, and comfort to the troubled Spirit.</q> So that men uſe Chriſt as ſick men take meat, not for love of it, or liking to it (for their Stomachs riſe againſt it) but for fear of death, which makes them force themſelves to eat. Though many come to Chriſt, it is by conſtraint, not willingly; not with delight, not as an healthy man comes to a full table, to feed with pleaſure. <hi>Many to avoid a greater miſchief, to avoid damnation, to avoid eternal torments will to Chriſt in their ſore extremities:</hi> they will then make large confeſſions, take up great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt their ſins, pray to God, and with vehemency and conſtancy, ſo as they never prayed before; but upon eaſe to the impoſtumed matter, upon recoveries out of their troubles, they become if not profane, yet worldly and negligent of Chriſt, his Perſon, his Laws, his Concernments. They have of Chriſt what they came for: They come to Chriſt, as ſome come to Shops, not to have all in the Shop, but what they immediately want: They want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and therefore they venture as the <hi>Leapers</hi> to the Camp of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> they had no love to them, they counted them their Enemies; but <hi>if we stay here, we periſh;</hi> or as <hi>Ladies</hi> uſe <hi>Litters,</hi> to carry them over the

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, multitudes have been <hi>affrighted</hi> to Chriſt, who were never truly and throughly <hi>converted</hi> to him, and have left their Sins from <hi>compulſion</hi> of their <hi>judgement,</hi> not from the <hi>propenſion</hi> of their <hi>will;</hi> not from any <hi>love</hi> they have borne to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> they <hi>love</hi> to be <hi>ſafe,</hi> but ſtill <hi>hate</hi> to be <hi>holy.</hi> O!

Will Chriſt accept of me, who have wronged his Father and him for ſo many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</q> O! how long doth many an awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Soul hang in doubts and fears, ere it will venture upon Chriſts graciouſneſs alone; and then, when the Soul hath long ſtood out, the fears increaſe. <q>I have refuſed Chriſt ſo long; to all my former tranſgreſſions I have added this, my puting off Chriſt and Salvation, when freely tendered, and therefore ſure I may not now come.</q> And now if Chriſt offers them mercy, ſtill they are fearful; they cannot believe that Chriſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49727:34"/>is ſerious and real. O! by theſe jealouſies of Chriſt, you provoke him not a little. You are ready to ſay, This is too good news to be true: What is this, but to ſay, The Goſpel is falſe, it is no true and faithful Word, 'tis not to be received with all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave the greateſt of ſinners, blaſphemers and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours of Chriſt? This is the great Sin that made Chriſt weep. You ſeldome find Chriſt weeping over the Idolaters of the World: I find him not weeping over <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah;</hi> but if <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> refuſe Chriſt, this makes him weep indeed, <hi>Hieruſalem,

O! this ſin of Unbelief hath great unkindneſs in it,

But what ſhall I ſay? So farr are Souls from coming to Chriſt, that they do ſeldome bewail this ſin, and ſeldome ſeek to God for power againſt it; and though men pretend they <hi>cannot</hi> come to Chriſt, yet the truth is, they will not (ſo Mr. <hi>Fenner, in his willful

As the Papiſts, ſo many Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours are for a divided Chriſt; few are for exalting Chriſt alone, ſo as to <hi>renounce all other Lords, who have had Dominion over them,</hi> and to count all other Teachers beſides Chriſt as vain, abſurd, unſound, and weak. Few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all their own righteouſneſs, as dung, to put the Crown on Chriſts head alone, to make Chriſt their alone Mediatour, their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Interceſſour.

They lay their title to God, Heaven, and Glory, partly from Chriſts merits, and partly from their own deſerts; few whoſe hopes are founded on Chriſt's ſatisfaction alone; but their hopes riſe or fall according to what they do for him, rather than according to what he hath done and ſuffered for them: their hopes of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God are more from their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than from Chriſts <hi>entring within the Vaile:</hi> If they have peace of Conſcience, they aſcribe it to their Prayers, rather than to Chriſts Interceſſion, and if they Pray in

Hence it is that many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are much more conſciencious in their obedience to the moral law, than they are to the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> for that they hope their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience will ſteed them aſmuch, if not more than Jeſus Chriſt; but if they underſtand that without <hi>Faith there is no pleaſing God,</hi> then they will labour for a faith that may juſtifie them, rather as an <hi>act</hi> of theirs, than in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>object Christ.</hi> Chriſt is ſtill uſed only upon neceſſity, and to make up the want of ſomewhat elſe; but very few dare reſt on the merits of Chriſt <hi>alone,</hi> ſo as to ſee <hi>all their righteouſneſs to be as filthy rags.</hi> To few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Riches are miſcall'd goods: they are not good ſure in their reference as they relate to Chriſt, as they come from Chriſt, from that boſome of love, and as they advance Chriſt, and bring Chriſt and the Soul to nearer Communion. If the World in its glory, ſplendour, and fulneſs, hinder communion with Chriſt, by deadning; flatning, and diſtracting the heart, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a burthen: He is burthened with friends, relations, enjoyments of all ſorts, that rob him of Chriſt, that ecclipſe the face of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, through their unhappy interpoſals.

               <p n="1">1. I am changed from what I was, nay, <hi>changed inwardly.</hi> So was <hi>Saul, And it was ſo,

Might not <hi>Saul</hi> ſay ſo much for himſelf? had not he the Spirit of Propheſie to admiration? When <hi>a company of Prophets met him,

Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</hi> He is ſtill ſearching that he may know more wherein he may pleaſe God, as willing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be more uſeful for God: What have I to do more? but how ſeldom do we ask our hearts, what way may we <hi>walk in all well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> How ſeldom do we <hi>deſign</hi> for the glory of God?</p>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that free and friendly converſe that ought to be maintained between God and your Souls, you will only flatter him in a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49727:57"/>ſervile manner, and bribe him not to be your Enemy. Worſhip God you muſt, for fear of incurring his diſpleaſure, and leſt your neglects of him ſhould rouze up his anger againſt you; but you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any chearful and friendly ſociety with a Beeing which appears in a dreſs ſo horrible to your Souls. Now between this neceſſity of coming to him, and that fearfullneſs to approach him, what can there be begotten, but a forced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Devotion, which, becauſe you do not love, you would willingly leave, did not the dread and horrour you have in your Souls of him, dragg you to his Altars? And what are you wont to do there? Truly nothing but cry, and look as if you were going to Execution, till you can flatter your ſelves into ſome hopes, that he is moved by your cries, and forced ſubmiſſions, to lay aſide his frowns, and caſt a better aſpect upon you: But your hard thoughts of God returning, you are conſtrained to renew your ſlaviſh Devotions, that you may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe another gracious look from him.

                  </q> No wonder therefore if God be ſo provoked at this ſin of evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. This is what I have obſerved very common among the Lords People, they will pray with ſome earneſtneſs, and perhaps have ſome confidence; that God is gracious, and will anſwer their prayers, and grant all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49727:58"/>their deſires; but no ſooner off from their knees, but (if they think of God, yet) they lay down their expectations of receiving any thing from God, and fall to diſtruſting and to renew their jealouſies of God as ſoon as they have done Praying. What? Is God <hi>yea and nay?</hi> Is he kind, when thou art on thy knees, and unkind as ſoon as off? Will God take it well from thee, that in thy duties thou ſhalt put to thy <hi>Seal that God is true,</hi> and loving, and minds thy good? And preſently take off the Seal, yea rather Seal to a parchment of the Devils drawing; that God is falſe, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and one that ſeeks thy ruine? O! whilſt there is a Devil, and a melancholy-humour to be wrought upon, I do even deſpair to ſee this curſed God-diſhonouring and debaſing ſin, to be quite rooted out of the hearts of Chriſtians; but yet it is a Provocation, and <hi>Let it be for a Lamentation.</hi>

How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will tell God twenty times over they are aſhamed of their Sins, and within one hour after they are not aſhamed to commit them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, no more aſhamed are they, than the Sow is to lye tumbling in the Mire? How will many tell God they fear him, and his Judgements, when indeed and intruth they fear neither, witneſs their frothy looſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and converſations? How will they tell God that all the world is but as a drop of a bucket in compariſon of his Majeſty, and that all fleſh is contemptible, when weighed with him, and yet they fear the wrath of Man more than the wrath of the Almighty God? How many will tell God that they are contented
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49727:99"/>with all his will, and yet their hearts are full of inward riſings againſt the Providence of God? How many tell God they believe in him, truſt to his Mercy, depend on Chriſt, and O! forſooth all their cares are caſt on Chriſt, when God knows, their care and work, like Bees, is to get honey to their hives? They <hi>mind earthly things,</hi> and are ſcraping the duſt of the Valleys to themſelves, as if they thought it their wiſdome rather to lean to their own providing, than to be beholding to the Lord and dye beggars? How earneſt are ſome in their cries to God for victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sin; but ſecretly hate it not? And doth it not appear in this, for that having direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Prayers to the Lord, they do not look up, to ſee whether the corruption be more mortified, and their love to it abated yea or no?</p>

<note place="margin">To men, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things.</note> How do many covet mightily to inſiſt on the refinements of hypocrites, and thereby they eſcape (as they hope at leaſt) from being judged ſuch themſelves? How have ſome ſtudied to diſgrace Sin to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and yet ſecretly cheriſhed that, which they laboured to make odious to others? In company they cry down ſelf-love, hypocriſie, formality, earthlyneſs, and pride, but private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they keep up theſe, and make them their companions. How Zealous have ſome been in diſcourſe for the Proteſtant Faith? How have they cryed out againſt errours, and for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49727:99"/>a reformation; but can tell no more of a work of God upon the heart than an Heathen? How have ſome contended for opinions, and have put a <hi>jus divinum</hi> upon ſuch and ſuch a way, and counted others as little better than Pagans, that would not ſubmit to their way, and yet by fear and flattery have ſoon faced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>

They are as the foreman to praiſe the rich, from whom they hope to ſqueeze ſome of their gold; but bring up the rear, are the laſt to commend them, from whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing of advantage by their glavering tongue. How much Hypocriſie hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our declaimings againſt others ſins? O! we muſt not ſuffer this: the Houſe of God muſt be kept clean: it muſt not be made a Den of Thieves, an Hog-ſty, and cage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs: and all this while their zeal is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but revenge; a ſecret grudge there is againſt the Delinquent, and now that an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage offereth, they will have their penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth out of him.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>WHen you remember the evil of your wayes,
<note place="margin">Profeſsors Sabbath-Sins.</note> of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly wayes, you may not omit your Sabbath-Sins.</hi> God hath appointed the Sabbath: He hath <hi>ſanctified</hi> it for ſpecial and entire communion with himſelf. The Law of the Sabbath was given before the Fall; becauſe man was to labour and dreſs the Garden on the ſix dayes, and therefore could not have that compleat and indiſtracted communion with God, even in his eſtate of innocency, which he might enjoy by a total ſeperation from all earthly and heterogeneous employments: But ſince the Fall, this Reſt is of more abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; for that we cannot now apply our minds
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49727:103"/>entirely to matters of ſo different a nature, as heavenly and earthly things are. The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is many wayes honourable: it was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſet apart by God; it was written with Gods own finger in the Tables; God rained Mannah on that day; it's called an <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant,</hi> by way of eminency, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Gods Covenant were kept, if this were not: Yea, God puts a <hi>Remember</hi> on this day, and no other: <hi>Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.</hi> 
                  <q>If a Friend ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to you, that he will come and ſolace himſelf in your company ſuch a day, and tells you the ſet time, when he will come; will he not take it ill, if you neglect him then? If you are full of employments, and other gueſts, and have no leiſure to attend communion with him? Thus ſaith God, Remember ſuch a time, I will ſet it apart on purpoſe to enjoy you, and feaſt you; I will then take you into my Cellars, my Wine Cellars, and (after an holy manner) inebriate you with Divine comforts: You are on your other dayes clogg'd and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with earthly affairs, ſo that I can have therein but broken communion with you; but pray <hi>Remember</hi> to lay aſide all other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, to reſt from all your other works, that I and you may freely converſe together.</q> But inſtead of this,</p>

Which of us diſpatcheth his worldly buſineſs ſeaſonably on the ſix dayes? Nay, is it not a wicked cuſtome, to engroſs more buſineſs into our hands and hearts the day before, than on any other day of the Week? Do not greedy Profeſſours ſit up la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night, than any other Night? Hereby their hearts are cumbred with the World, and their natural ſtrength and ſpirits waſted and ſpent, ſo that they cannot with a <hi>free Spirit</hi> wait upon God. Such is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that is due to the ſolemn and publick Duties of Devotion, that they require, not only a ſurceaſe from other works and thoughts, for the time of the performance; but alſo a decent preparation before-hand, that we <hi>look to our feet,</hi> &amp;c. that ſo our thoughts and affections, which are naturally bent upon the World, and not eaſily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from it, may be raiſed to a diſpoſition becoming the day. God alone knows, how oft the Devil, and our own hearts, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled us with occaſions on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> whereby our minds have been diſtracted on the Sabbath: Yea, have we not at times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſecretly wiſhed, that the Sabbath were over, or might be adjourned, that we might purſue ſome worldly deſign, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by its interpoſal? The <hi>Sabbath</hi> is the Saints <hi>Market-day,</hi> or <hi>Fair-day:</hi> You know what preparations are made, by World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for their dayes of gain; would to God

How many think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a diſgrace to their noble Spirits, to be ſtill and ſilent, even under the hand of God, but they muſt be clamorous, and ſpeaking againſt the very Heavens? They are ready to ſay, This was not well done by God, he might have given, or continued to us, this and the other mercy: They miſlike many of Gods Diſpenſations of Providence: they cannot heartily ſay, that <hi>God holds the reins beſt,</hi> and and guides all his affairs with the greateſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: they think if they were the Orderers of matters in the World, things would be better governed: like proud <hi>Abſolon,</hi>

               <p>ENVY is a Sin ſeldome confeſſed,
<note place="margin">Profeſsoss Envy. <hi>James</hi> 4.5.</note> but yet much diffuſed among Profeſſours. <hi>The Spirit that dwelleth in us, luſteth to Envy.</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:49727:141"/>And indeed <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> are never aſunder: they are ſins againſt the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Such as long, that what is their Neighbours, ſhould be theirs, envy to him that which is his: and ſuch as envy to him that which is his, long to have it to be theirs. How deſirous are Profeſſours to graſp all to themſelves? And therefore how apt are the very beſt to be envious at the power, greatneſs, riches, if not goodneſs of others? Doth not the experience that you have of your own hearts (if you be not ſtrangers at home) teſtiſie, that this Spirit is ſtirring and acting in you? The poor envy the rich, the baſe the honourable, as if they had the leſs, becauſe others have ſo much. Some think that this was the ſin that threw down the Angels from Heaven, that they envied <hi>Adam</hi>'s glory, in that he was made after Gods image, and that they relinquiſhed their glory to diveſt <hi>Adam</hi> of his: To be ſure, the Devil was reſtleſs, till he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plunged <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſame ſin and miſery, that he was brought into. Sure, maligning the proſperity of others, is not from the Spirit of God. He that giveth freely to all, would not have us to envy thoſe, to whom he gives more freely, than to our ſelves; and he that giveth us more, doth not envy us for what we have. If you have not ſo much as others, it is becauſe you are unfit to receive, not becauſe God is unwilling to give. Do not we ſee how this poyſon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth it ſelf? An early ſin it was, if not in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49727:141"/>the Angels, (as ſome think) yet it was in <hi>Eve:</hi> She envied the all-knowledge of God, and muſt forſooth have at leaſt an equality with God himſelf: It was alſo ſtrong in the firſt man, that was born of a woman: and we ſtill ſuck it in with our Mothers milk, and it ſeldome dyes till we dye. This ſinne is commonly among people of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: One Mechanick envies another, one Merchant another, one Scholar another, one Gentleman another, one Commander another, as <hi>Saul</hi> envied and hated <hi>David,</hi> becauſe the Women ſang, that <hi>Saul ſlew his thouſands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands,</hi> one Miniſter another, as thoſe in <hi>Paul</hi>'s dayes, that envied him, and affected an high ſtrain of eloquence, on purpoſe to obſcure that reputation which <hi>Paul</hi> had got among the Churches. And happy had it been, if this curſed ſinne had dyed in that age, but it hath been ſtill working in all ages of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is there not a greater promptitude in us,

It is admirable to ſee, how dull ſighted we are, as to the vertues and graces of our Brethren, but quick ſighted as Eagles to diſcern their

How few conſult and believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's ſetting forth the enmity of wicked men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods people?</hi> The Scripture tells us, <hi>They eat up Gods people, as bread,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a ſtrange inclination in them to devour the Saints, and that they take as great delight therein, as an hungry man in eating, and that it is natural to them to moleſt them: The Scripture compares them, for their hurtful qualities, to <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> to <hi>Foxes</hi> for ſubtilty, to wild <hi>Bulls,</hi> to greedy <hi>Swine,</hi> to <hi>Scorpions,</hi> to <hi>Bryars</hi> and <hi>Thornes,</hi> (grievous and vexing things.) The Scripture repreſents them as induſtrious and unwearied in their bloody Enterprizes, they cannot ſleep without doing miſchief: <hi>Herodias</hi> had rather have <hi>the blood of a Saint,</hi> than <hi>half of a Kingdom: Haman</hi> would pay a great Fine to the King, ſo the ſcattered <hi>Jews (who
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49727:210"/>keep not the Kings laws)</hi> may be cut off. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men will run the hazard of damning their own Souls, rather than not fling a <hi>dagger</hi> at <hi>the Apple of Gods eye:</hi> though they know, what one word (Aha) coſt; yet they will break through all natural, civil, and moral obligations to ruine Gods people: The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt calls them <hi>implacable men,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.</note> fierce</hi> and <hi>headſtrong:</hi> they are like the <hi>hot Oven</hi> for <hi>fury,</hi> like the <hi>Sea</hi> for <hi>boundleſs rage:</hi> yet <hi>who hath believed</hi> this Scripture <hi>Report?</hi>

                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:49727:210"/>we would not count any of the Saints ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from danger, though related to any great wicked man: we would not twiſt our ſelves with them by matching our ſelves or Children to theſe Sons and Daughters of <hi>Belial:</hi> neither would we make choice of Devils to be our Servants</q>

It is an <hi>Iron Age</hi> we live in, and mens hearts are ſtrangely hardned, as to any pitty they ſhew to the multitudes, who are in a natural and damnable condition. Me-thinks you ſhould reflect on the miſery of an unconverted ſtate, whilſt you your ſelves were ſo lately in it.</p>
               <p>Are not you convinced,
<note place="margin">Several weighty Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, to perſwade Profeſsors to be treating with Souls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their eternal Eſtate, what-ever company they are in.</note> that thoſe with whom you converſe daily, have reaſonable, immortal Souls, capable of eternal life or miſery? Have not they the ſame common Nature with you? Are there not (at leaſt) many civil bonds, wherein you ſtand related to them? Doth not their <hi>miſery</hi> call aloud for your <hi>compaſſions?</hi> Are they not <hi>in the gall of bitterneſs, and bonds of iniquity?</hi> Have they yet any part or fellowſhip in the pardon of their Sins? The endeavouring to heal the back-ſlidings of Chriſtians, though a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary work, is not ſo neceſſary (for they will ſurely be pardoned and healed, they are not in ſuch hazard of damnation) as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <hi>to open the eyes</hi> of theſe poor blind wretches, and <hi>to turn them from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Would you not make more haſte to cure a man, that is taken with a ſwooning fit, than one that hath a little ſwelling in his ſinger? I wonder you are no more affected with the miſeries that attend your Unregenerate Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who muſt ſuddenly be Converted, or Damned: Me-thinks you ſhould pitty them
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:49727:213"/>the more; becauſe they pitty not themſelves. Me-thinks the value that Chriſt hath put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Souls, by bleeding for them, the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome that he hath given for miſerable man, and the unwearied pains he takes for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of fall'n man, ſhould teach us to open our lips, to give ſome directions and counſels to them, who are within a ſtride of Hell, but a breath between them and eternal ruine: And yet how are Gods people ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards theſe forlorn and miſerable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, condemned Creatures? Though they are under the curſe of the Law, though the ſentence of death be paſt againſt them, and is ready to be executed every moment; yet you exhort them not to <hi>flye from wrath to come:</hi> If they will periſh, they may periſh, for any ſpiritual contribution that you will afford them. It grieves me ſometimes, to ſee how Gods people eat up their own and others time, with vain, frothy and unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words: When they ſhould be ſpeaking ſome rouzing, ſtartling words of Hell and Damnation, of the neceſſity of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of Eternity, of the fooliſh choice men make in preferring <hi>the pleaſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> before <hi>eternal</hi> joyes; of the deceits of the heart, of the cheats of the Devil, of the malignity of ſin, of the curſe of the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are talking of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, or of that, they are perhaps cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another, but endeavouring nothing for the undeceiving their deluded Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You cannot but know what advantages
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:49727:213"/>you have by your intimacies with them, to deliver that to them, which they will receive from you, when Satan perhaps hath imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them againſt their Miniſters, ſo that all Pulpit-counſels and reproofs are loſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Beſides, You are in private with them, and you know by your ſelves, how loth, how backward you were, to apply the truths of God to your own Souls, but you, as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> may goe and ſay, <hi>Thou art the Man, thou the Woman:</hi> You may hear their pleas for themſelves, and ſo have an opportunity to confute them; whereas they are reſerved to their Miniſters, though they have been friendly, earneſtly and frequently invited to a Chriſtian conference: And yet how do you neglect all theſe Opportunities of ſerving the Neceſſities of your Friends: You pretend love unto them; but how can ye ſee the blind before your eyes tumbling into the Lake of Hell, and yet not call on them to return and live? It is admirable, that you ſhould think you have the Divine Nature within you, and yet be void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions to theſe miſerable Objects, who lye wounded before you, where-ever you goe or come. O! Me-thinks, when you enter the houſe of an Unregenerate, you ſhould thus meditate, <hi>Now have I an opportunity to ſave a Soul from Hell, to have a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt than</hi> Caeſar <hi>or</hi> Alexander <hi>could boaſt of: Now may I ſhew my ſelf a Friend of God, by pleading his right to the Creature: Now may I have an occaſion to make all the Angels of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49727:214"/>Heaven laugh and ſing, and all the curſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to roar, by ſaving a loſt Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And will you ſee theſe wounded in your way, and paſs them by with an unmerciful Spirit? <hi>If you ſee your Brother have need of outward things,</hi> (much more if needing Grace, the Image of, and Peace with, God) <hi>and you ſhut up your bowells of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in you?</hi> You have ſome pitty left, when you ſee a man fall'n under his horſe, or ſtrugling for life upon the waters, or in an houſe fired, your bowells are turned within you; But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! here are they that are dropping into the Lake of Fire every moment, that are drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up and down, from one Luſt to another, by the Devil, (a ſorer bondage by farr) and yet you do not pitty them. O! Pitty them, pitty them; <hi>Goe over to</hi> Macedonia, <hi>and help them.</hi> It is a grief to my Soul, to conſider, how dull, how uſeleſs Chriſtians are, in the Towns and Villages, where Providence hath caſt them: If they meet with a man, they will not ſo much as ask, whether he be bound for Heaven, or Hell? whether he knows the neceſſity of the new Birth, yea or no? whether he hath left Sin, as his greateſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, whether he be willing of Chriſt, and Salvation by him, upon his own terms? Nay, Profeſſours will not ſo much as counſel them to read a good Book, or lend them one, if they are poor and unable to buy: they will be at no coſt to ſave a Soul, that is really of more worth, than a World. How
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:49727:214"/>is it, that you account your ſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whilſt you have no higher eſteems of Souls? Or how can you have any aſſurance, that you hate Sin, whilſt you labour not the removal of it, in whomſoever you find it? If you ſee men trifling away their time, why do you not put them upon redeeming their time? If you find them lovers of pleaſures, why do you not invite them, and preſs them, to look after cordial joy and mirth, and the true pleaſures, that are at Gods right hand? If you are the Subjects of Chriſt, how can you endure Treaſon againſt him, and not ſuppreſs it? I'le never believe, that man ever mourned for ſins of his own, that doth not for ſins of others; or that he ever hated ſin in himſelf, that doth not endeavour to ruine it in others Souls, as well as in his own. Be aſhamed at your pretenſions, as if you had hearts of fleſh, when you have hearts of ſtones, the hearts of Tygers, the hearts of Infidels, or elſe you would pitty the miſerable unconverted Souls. And what, if they deſire not your help: the more need you have to pitty them: the leſs awakened they are out of their curſed ſecurity, the more miſerable and dangerous is their ſtate. O! Put on the bowells of Jeſus Chriſt: car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not your ſelves in an high, proud way, in a lofty, magiſterial way, towards theſe poor Souls: Do not think thou haſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged duty towards them, by running into a corner, and backbiting them for blindneſs, hardneſs, contempt of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:49727:215"/>help them to ſome of your eye-ſalve, that they may ſee. Conſider you have Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and account you muſt for them, and be-think your ſelves, whether you may not give a better account, by endeavouring to reduce theſe poor Souls, that are ſtraying to Hell, than by letting them alone to damn themſelves: Conſider ſadly what anſwer you will make, when Chriſt ſhall ariſe and plead with you, when Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>Where is thy Brother?</hi> Will <hi>Cain</hi>'s anſwer ſerve? <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> Will not Chriſt reply on you? <q>Did not I come from Heaven on purpoſe to redeem theſe periſh Souls? Did not I charge you to <hi>exhort one another daily?</hi> to <hi>do good to all?</hi> Did not I furniſh you with wiſdome and experience, that you might be able and ready to help o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Did not I by wonders of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence prolong your dayes, that you might be uſeful? Did not I give you an intereſt in the affections of your Neighbours, that you might be <hi>as the Dew,</hi> and <hi>as the Rivers of Waters to the parched ground?</hi> that you might be the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Salt of the Earth?</hi> Nay, did not I remove the Miniſtry, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other weighty grounds) to try your affections to periſhing Souls? And is this your anſwering all my deſigns and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to rail at them, as the ungodly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not to endeavour to make them better?</q> O! Conſider how ſad your caſe will be, if the blood of thouſands of Souls ſhall be lain at your doors, for your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:49727:215"/>for your careleſsneſs, for your being worſe than <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs; for he once repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, perhaps you have never. How do you know, but a few words of yours might be as forcible as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> woman's was to the City? Is this to <hi>love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf?</hi> Do'ſt love thy ſelf, and not regard thy Soul? And canſt thou love thy Neighbour, and not endeavour to ſave him from periſhing? to pull the brand out of the fire? Have you ſo learned Chriſt? When our Lord dwelt in fleſh among us, was he dumb before ſinners, as you are, when he ſaw the multitude want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bread, did not he deal forth the bread of life to them? did not he prefer this work before his meat and drink? had not he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion for the ignorant? did not he enlighten poor ignorant Souls? and reprove the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of others? When he went into the Publicans houſes, did not he preach of the Kingdome of God unto them? And hath not he given you an enample, that you ſhould do as he hath done? Should not you make it a matter of Conſcience to write after ſo great, ſo ſafe, ſo glorious a Copy? to follow ſo worthy a Leader and Pattern? Add withall, what ſtumbling blocks you have laid in the wayes of ſinners? how many have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by your converſation? And will you ſend ſo many hundreds to Hell, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the converſion of ſome? You pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the want of parts: But alas! you want bowels, you want affections, you have not
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:49727:216"/>a real ſight, and deep ſenſe of eternal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: If you had, you would with tears in your eyes beſeech your Neighbours to mind their periſhing Souls. Have not you ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts as to ſay to your Neighbours, <hi>Repent,</hi> and <hi>Pray, if perhaps your ſins may be forgiven.</hi> Go into thy Cloſet, Profeſſour, and there mourn over thy hard heartedneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs to the Souls of thouſands, of whom thou might'ſt have been an inſtrument of Converſion, if thou hadſt but attempted it. Or could you not have gone and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched your Miniſters to lay to heart the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtate of ſuch a man or woman? Or might you not have entreated thoſe Souls to conſult ſome Miniſter about their Everlaſting State? You have not done what you could: you pretend you cannot convert them; but you will not, you will not try whether you can work them over from ſin to God. You ſay they are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, they have hearts of ſtone, as inſenſible as ſtones, as ſtupid, as blockiſh, as impenetrable as ſtones: And waſt not thou ſo ſome years ago? Haſt thou forgot <hi>the rock, out of which thou waſt hewn?</hi> Nay, is there not too much ſtone in thy heart, that thou canſt ſee thy God ſo diſhonoured, Chriſt ſo reproached by thoſe, who are baptized in his Name, and wear his Livery,, and yet not endeavour to pull them out of the fire? Thou relieveſt thy ſelf with the mercy thou ſheweſt to the bodies of the poor, that beg at thy door: when thou ſeeſt their ſoars, their lean cheeks,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:49727:216"/>and naked ſhoulders, thou ſuccoureſt them, there things thou oughteſt to do; but not to lay aſide the Spiritual Almes, that were due unto them: thou ſhouldſt have counſelled them, admoniſhed them, enlightned them; and now if they periſh in their ignorance, will not their blood be required at thy hands? O! tremble at your blood-guiltineſs. The Lord of Heaven and Earth, who layes his claim to Souls, <hi>All Souls are mine,</hi> hath charged thee, <hi>not</hi> to <hi>hate thy Brother in thine heart, not</hi> to <hi>ſuffer ſin to reſt upon him, but</hi> to <hi>reprove him:</hi> And yet thou letteſt him alone, to periſh in his iniquity. You are ſo taken up with your own temporal or eternal good, that you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regard what becomes of others to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. How do ſome hope to ſlink to Heaven alone? Perhaps they <hi>ſeek their own profit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.33.</note> but <hi>not the profit of many, that they may be ſaved. O that men would caſt their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>the very dumb inanimate Creatures would teach them better; every Creature aſsimulates, Fire turns what is near it into Fire, Earth converts into Earth, Flowers will be ſcattering of their ſeed and ſcent.</hi> How canſt thou hope the bleſſing of the new Creation reſts upon thee, when thou doſt not increaſe and multiply?

Is it not your Honour to bring many Sons and Daughters unto God? What will become of the next Generation? How few Servants (if any) will Chriſt have, if others take no more pains, than you do, to convince, to allure, to convert? I fear Chriſt will take up the old complaint,

I ſhall bleſs God for ever and ever, if this your negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Souls of thoſe, whom you may account without, may be cordially bewailed, and you for the future double your diligence for their converſion. Miniſters cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert without the Concourſe of Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, neither can you. Though Satan and thy own lazy heart hath told thee, thou art unfit to ſet upon this work, yet better do it meanly, than wholy omit it. God (like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents on earth) loves to ſee his Children lift at thoſe duties, which are too hard for them,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:49727:218"/>and then he ſteps in and is a Co-worker with them. What God did by illiterate Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> he can do by thee. The Lord pardon thy former unmercifulneſs to the Souls of men; But if thou continue careleſs and cruel, if thou wilt not by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for them, and counſels to them, ſeek their reducement, as ſure as thou art reading, the voyce of thy Brothers blood is crying againſt thee from the earth. By your example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if not ſince) Profeſſion, you have been the cauſe of the deſtruction of Souls, of how many who can tell.

O! how many Souls are crying in Hell againſt thee, curſing the day they knew thee, or their Anceſtours knew thee; for that by thee they learned to ſin the more, and were ſtrengthned in their wickedneſs by thy tongue, and by thy life? And now are not you bound to do your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to make reſtitution? to labour to ſave them that be alive? Is it not reaſonable that you ſhould labour to win Souls to Gods, as you have to the Devils, ſervice? and to have many bleſſing God in the Heavens for you, that ever they were in the company of ſuch an active zealous Chriſtian, who by word and life was inſtrumental to bring them
